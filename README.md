# dashboard-landing-page

Project Overview

This project is a dashboard interface built using HTML and CSS.
It includes a collapsible sidebar, navigation icons, a search bar, and a partner-management table layout.

Features

Sidebar Menu
A slide-out sidebar controlled by a checkbox toggle. It contains:

App title and logo

Search input

Navigation links (Dashboard, Notifications, Messages, Settings...)

Group section with expandable items

A list of secondary actions and a “New Group” button

Top Table Navigation
Shows the current page path (Partner Management / All Applicants).

Partners Section
Displays partner avatars, an add button, and extra menu.

Icons System
All icons are SVG-based for clean visuals and easy CSS styling.

How It Works

The sidebar visibility is controlled using an <input type="checkbox"> + <label>.

Each section of the dashboard is organized with semantic HTML (section, ul, li, div).

CSS handles:

Layout and positioning

Animations for sidebar

Styling for icons, fonts, and table sections
